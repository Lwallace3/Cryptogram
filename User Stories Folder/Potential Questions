Would you like a variety of difficulty levels for the Cryptograms? (easy, medium and hard?)
How long should each cryptogram be in length?
In the brief it mentions a scoreboard, how should the score of each user be determined?
What should be included in the player statistics on the scoreboard?
Does the software require a GUI/console interface?
Where do the messages come from? Input from external file? Input by the user?
Can you have more than one cryptogram open? Work on multiple cryptograms simultaneously? Swich between them?
Does each cryptogram save so that it can be completed another time?
